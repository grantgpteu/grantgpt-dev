# Progress Tracker

*This file tracks what works, what's left to build, the current status, and known issues.*

## What Works

*   **Memory Bank Structure:** Core files exist and have been reviewed and updated as of 2025-09-05.
*   **Project Brief:** Goals are clearly defined and remain current.
*   **Design Guidelines:** Visual requirements are documented and remain current.
*   **Initial Codebase:** GrantGPT fork exists.
*   **Basic Tech Stack Identification:** Core technologies documented and remain current.
*   **System Architecture Outline:** Basic architecture documented and remains current.
*   **Git Remotes:** Configured correctly (`origin` for push, `upstream` for fetch).
*   **Rebranding Applied:** Text and visual rebranding applied to codebase (creation of `grantgpt-theme.js`, updates to `globals.css` and `layout.tsx`).
*   **Workflow Robustness:** Improved the `rebrand.yml` GitHub Actions workflow to handle missing `package-lock.json` files.
*   **Specific Component Styling:**
    *   Updated `AgenticToggle.tsx` for correct "on" state background.
    *   Integrated this `AgenticToggle.tsx` change into the `rebrand.yml` workflow.

## What's Left to Build / Do

*   **Verify Rebranding:** Visually inspect the application (once deployed or locally built from `origin/main`) to confirm the automated rebranding applied correctly via `rebrand.yml`.
*   **Test Deployment Workflow:** Test the updated deployment process defined in `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml`.
*   **Test Let's Encrypt Script:** Test the updated `deployment/docker_compose/init-letsencrypt.sh` script in a relevant environment.
*   **Future Sync/Rebrand:** Plan and execute the next synchronization and rebranding cycle when required.
*   **Refine Memory Bank:** Continuously update Memory Bank files as the project evolves and deeper understanding is gained. (Current update cycle completed on 2025-09-05).
*   **Local Sync (Optional):** Decide if/when to synchronize the local repository with `origin/main`.

## Current Status (as of 2025-09-05)

*   **Repository State (`origin/main`):** The `origin/main` branch is at commit `175c4dc51426667f6d128c655c75ad48b61fbe2f` (Note: This commit hash is from previous context and may need verification if further pushes to origin/main have occurred).
*   **Rebranding:** The codebase has been automatically rebranded (text, logos, CSS colors) via the `rebrand.yml` workflow and manually updated in `web/src/app/globals.css` and `web/src/app/layout.tsx`. Visual confirmation is pending.
*   **Workflow/Scripts:**
    *   The deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml`) and the Let's Encrypt script (`deployment/docker_compose/init-letsencrypt.sh`) have been updated on `origin/main`.
    *   The `.github/workflows/rebrand.yml` workflow was updated to robustly handle `npm ci` by ensuring `package-lock.json` exists, and to include specific styling for `AgenticToggle.tsx`.
*   **Local State:** The local repository is currently *behind* `origin/main` and reflects an older state from 2025-09-04.
*   **Previous State (as of 2025-09-04):**
    *   Repository was reset to `upstream/main` (`9b6c762...`) preserving `.github` from `6765905...`. Local HEAD was `46b0a04...`.
    *   Codebase reflected Onyx branding (except `.github`).
    *   History prior to the reset was overwritten locally.

## Known Issues / Bugs

*   **Local Repository Out of Sync:** The local repository does not reflect the latest changes present on `origin/main` (commit `175c4dc...` - see note above).
*   **Rebranding Verification Pending:** The outcome of the automated rebranding (`rebrand.yml`) has not been visually verified.
*   **globals.css Update Method:** The `web/src/app/globals.css` file was updated using `write_to_file` due to issues with `replace_in_file`, which may require future attention.
*   **Rebrand Workflow Reliability:** The `rebrand.yml` workflow previously had a potential failure point if `package-lock.json` was missing at the root; this has been addressed.
