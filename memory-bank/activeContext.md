# Active Context

*This file tracks the current focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions.*

## Current Focus

*   Updating the Memory Bank to reflect the current state of the GrantGPT codebase and project.

## Recent Changes (Previous Session - 2025-08-04)

*   Read all existing Memory Bank files.
*   Populated Memory Bank files and created `.clinerules`.
*   Successfully synchronized with upstream using `git merge upstream/main`.
*   Resolved post-sync TypeScript and CSS errors.
*   Applied text and visual rebranding.
*   Committed changes and verified push status.
*   Updated Memory Bank files.

## Recent Changes (Current Session - 2025-11-04)

*   **Memory Bank Update Task:** Initiated task to update the Memory Bank.
*   **Read Memory Bank:** Read all files in `memory-bank/` (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `design-guidelines.md`).
*   **Identified Discrepancy:** Determined that the Memory Bank files reflected an outdated state (post-reset to upstream on 2025-09-04) and did not account for recent changes pushed directly to `origin/main`.
*   **Gathered Current State Information:** Received details about recent changes on `origin/main`:
    *   **Rebranding:** The `rebrand.yml` GitHub Actions workflow was run, applying automated text, logo, and CSS color changes based on `design-guidelines.md`. (Visual verification pending).
    *   **Deployment Workflow:** `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml` was updated to use `git archive`, `scp`, and selective server-side file deletion.
    *   **Let's Encrypt Script:** `deployment/docker_compose/init-letsencrypt.sh` was updated (dynamic compose command, Nginx readiness check, etc.).
    *   **Latest Commit:** The current HEAD commit on `origin/main` is `175c4dc51426667f6d128c655c75ad48b61fbe2f`.
*   **Applied Rebranding:** Applied text and visual rebranding by creating `web/tailwind-themes/grantgpt-theme.js` and updating `web/src/app/globals.css` and `web/src/app/layout.tsx`.
*   **Encountered Issues:** Experienced difficulties with `replace_in_file` and switched to using `write_to_file` to update `web/src/app/globals.css`.
*   **Workflow Fix (2025-05-06):** Updated `.github/workflows/rebrand.yml` to ensure `package-lock.json` is generated if missing before `npm ci` is run, resolving a potential workflow failure.
*   **AgenticToggle Styling (2025-05-06):**
    *   Modified `web/src/app/chat/input/AgenticToggle.tsx` to use `bg-secondary` for the track's background when the toggle is in the "on" state.
    *   Updated `.github/workflows/rebrand.yml` to include this specific `AgenticToggle.tsx` modification in the automated rebranding process.

## Next Steps

*   **Verify Rebranding:** Visually inspect the application (once deployed or locally built from `origin/main`) to confirm the automated rebranding applied correctly.
*   **Test Deployment:** Test the updated deployment workflow (`deploy-dev.yml`) to ensure it functions as expected.
*   **Test Let's Encrypt:** Test the updated `init-letsencrypt.sh` script.
*   **Local Sync (Optional):** Decide if/when to synchronize the local repository with `origin/main` (e.g., using `git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main`).

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Source of Truth:** The `origin/main` branch (currently at commit `175c4dc...`) is the current source of truth, containing the latest code including automated rebranding and workflow updates.
*   **Local State:** The local repository is currently *behind* `origin/main` and reflects the state from 2025-09-04 (reset to upstream + preserved `.github`). No fetch/reset was performed locally during this session.
*   **Rebranding Status:** The codebase on `origin/main` is assumed to be rebranded based on the `rebrand.yml` workflow execution.
*   **globals.css Update:** The `web/src/app/globals.css` file was updated using `write_to_file` due to issues with `replace_in_file`.
